# House-Price-Prediction

Regression is one of the Supervised learning algorithms. Regression Predictive Modelling is the task of constructing a 
succinct model that allows you to make predictions from data based on mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to 
output variables (y). It by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed, continuous-valued 
response. Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power
usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression. 

We will create a model that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (lotsize, number of bedrooms 
,...). The dataset can be downloaded from <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Housing.csv">here</a>.
